# Design Notes — ESP32 Tailscale Subnet Router Web UI

## Aesthetic Direction

**Domain:** Embedded device admin dashboard. Not editorial, not marketing — operational.

**Override:** Explicitly overrides the Opus 4.7 default house style (cream/serif/terracotta). That aesthetic is wrong for a router admin panel.

**Chosen direction:** Linear / Cloudflare Dashboard

| Token | Value | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Page bg | `#0d0f12` | Near-black, not pure black — avoids harsh contrast, matches modern dev tools |
| Card bg | `#161a1f` | One tier up from page, clearly distinct without gradients |
| Elevated card | `#1e2329` | For inputs, hover states, nested containers |
| Accent | `#3b82f6` | Tailwind blue-500 — recognisable, professional, not the existing cyan glow |
| Success | `#22c55e` | Flat green, no gradient |
| Warning | `#f59e0b` | Amber, matches severity conventions |
| Danger | `#ef4444` | Red, matches severity conventions |
| Info | `#06b6d4` | Cyan kept for informational only (not accent), echoes existing brand |

**What was deliberately avoided:**
- `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea, #764ba2)` — the existing purple gradient buttons look like generic Tailwind UI examples, not a custom tool
- `text-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,217,255,0.3)` — the cyan glow heading style, which reads as dated "cyberpunk dark mode"
- `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` glassmorphism — attractive in screenshots, causes GPU compositing overhead on mobile Safari and contributes nothing to usability

**Typography:**
System font stack (`-apple-system, 'Segoe UI', system-ui, sans-serif`) for UI chrome — no CDN font load, zero latency on first paint. Monospace stack (`'SF Mono', 'Geist Mono', 'Cascadia Code', ui-monospace, monospace`) for IPs, MACs, CIDRs, and log output. These are credentials the user needs to read and copy accurately — monospace is functional, not decorative.

**The one memorable detail:** Left-border accent stripes on cards convey severity/state at a glance without colour flooding the whole card. A green-left-striped uplink card and a red-left-striped heap card communicate status before the user reads a single label. This is borrowed from VS Code's problem list and GitLab's pipeline status — it works because it is spatially anchored.

## Why No Framework

### Why not React / Vue / Svelte

The ESP32 HTTP server serves a single static file. Build tooling would require a separate host-side compile step, a `dist/` artifact, and a deployment procedure. The target developer (Csontikka, or any contributor) should be able to edit the HTML file and `idf.py flash` — no `npm install` required.

Vanilla JS is sufficient for:
- Tab navigation (7 lines)
- `fetch('/api/status')` polling (30 lines)
- DOM patching on response (the `applyStatus()` function)
- Toast system (~20 lines)
- Confirm modal (~15 lines)

Total JS in the prototype: ~250 lines. A React app doing the same thing would be 50KB+ of runtime before a single line of application code.

### Why not Tailwind CDN

The CDN version ships ~3.5MB of CSS (all utilities). Even the Play CDN with JIT is ~300KB. The production build constraint is <100KB gzip total. Tailwind is the wrong tool when you control the entire design token surface anyway — CSS custom properties achieve the same consistency without the dependency.

---

## Navigation Pattern

**Top nav with pill-shaped active tab** — chosen over:

- Sidebar: wastes horizontal space on mobile; requires a hamburger overlay mechanism; common on desktop apps but friction-heavy for first-time setup on a phone
- Bottom nav (mobile): familiar on consumer apps, but admin tools are not consumer apps; bottom nav implies ≤5 items with icons only — the 6-item set with labels doesn't fit cleanly
- Page-per-URL multi-page: would require the ESP32 to serve 6+ separate HTML files, adding RAM/flash pressure; SPA avoids that

The tab strip scrolls horizontally on mobile with `overflow-x: auto; scrollbar-width: none` — tabs never wrap or truncate, and the active tab is always visible because the JS scrolls it into view on activation.

**data-page attribute routing:** Each `.nav-tab` has `data-page="section-id"`. The JS listener toggles `.active` on both the tab and the matching `#page-{section}` div. No router library needed. Deep linking is not required (the device has no persistent URL state worth bookmarking).

## Performance Budget

Measured on the prototype (uncompressed / estimated gzip):

| Asset | Raw | Gzip estimate |
|-------|-----|---------------|
| CSS (design tokens + components) | ~14 KB | ~3.5 KB |
| HTML structure (all 6 page sections) | ~12 KB | ~3 KB |
| JavaScript (nav + fetch + DOM updates) | ~8 KB | ~2.5 KB |
| Inline SVG icons (~20 icons at ~150 bytes each) | ~3 KB | ~1 KB |
| **Total prototype** | **~37 KB** | **~10 KB** |

Target for full production build (all 6 pages fully implemented):

| Phase | Raw estimate | Gzip estimate |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Status + nav chrome | ~40 KB | ~11 KB |
| + Network page (forms + tables) | +10 KB | +3 KB |
| + Tailscale page | +8 KB | +2.5 KB |
| + Firewall page | +6 KB | +2 KB |
| + Tools page | +8 KB | +2.5 KB |
| + System page | +8 KB | +2.5 KB |
| **Full SPA total** | **~80 KB** | **~24 KB** |

Well within the 100 KB gzip budget. The ESP32 SPIFFS/LittleFS partition is typically 1–4 MB so raw size is fine too.

**Optimisation levers if needed:**
1. Remove stub page HTML from prototype — production pages render their sections lazily via JS template strings rather than static HTML
2. SVG icons: deduplicate with `<use href="#icon-id">` and a hidden `<svg>` sprite at top of body — saves ~2 KB
3. Minify CSS + JS with a one-shot Python/Node script in the build pipeline — no Webpack required

## API Contract Assumptions

The JS `applyStatus()` function expects `GET /api/status` to return:

```json
{
  "uplink": {
    "connected": true,
    "ssid": "HomeNetwork_5G",
    "ip": "192.168.1.47",
    "rssi": -62,
    "channel": 6,
    "band": "2.4 GHz"
  },
  "ap": {
    "ssid": "ESP32_IoT_AP",
    "ip": "192.168.4.1",
    "mac": "7C:DF:A1:5E:3B:02",
    "channel": 6,
    "clients": 3
  },
  "heap_free": 191488,
  "heap_total": 258048,
  "uptime_sec": 188820,
  "last_reboot": "2026-05-18T09:41:00",
  "reset_reason": "POWER_ON",
  "tailscale": {
    "enabled": true,
    "connected": true,
    "ip": "100.64.0.12",
    "hostname": "esp32-router",
    "routes": ["192.168.4.0/24"],
    "exit_node": null,
    "peers_online": 4,
    "peers_total": 6,
    "peers": [
      {"name": "laptop-work", "ip": "100.64.0.1", "online": true, "path": "direct"},
      {"name": "pi-homelab",  "ip": "100.64.0.3", "online": true, "path": "DERP"}
    ]
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "status": "ok",
    "boot_count": 47,
    "flash_count": 12
  }
}
```

The status response should also include a top-level `snmp` object:
```json
"snmp": {
  "enabled": true,
  "running": true
}
```
This allows a future status-page badge without a separate fetch.

**`reset_reason` string values expected:** `POWER_ON`, `SW_RESET`, `PANIC`, `WDT`, `BROWNOUT`, `FLASH`, `DEEP_SLEEP`

These map to badge colours in `resetReasonDisplay()`. If the C backend uses numeric codes instead, add a translation table in JS — do not change the JS/CSS architecture.

### SNMP agent endpoint

```
GET  /api/snmp   →  current config + live state
POST /api/snmp   ←  partial or full update; agent restarts in-place
```

Response shape:
```json
{
  "enabled":      true,
  "running":      true,
  "community":    "public",
  "sys_name":     "esp32-router",
  "sys_contact":  "",
  "sys_location": ""
}
```

`running` reflects whether the agent task is currently listening (may differ
from `enabled` for a brief window after a Save while the agent restarts).
The UI re-fetches `/api/snmp` 2 s after a successful POST to update the
Status badge.

### SNMP implementation notes (as built)

The three assumptions this section originally carried all turned out to be
wrong once the feature was implemented. What actually shipped:

**There is no lwIP SNMP agent to enable.** `CONFIG_LWIP_SNMP` is **not** a
Kconfig option in ESP-IDF 5.5.3. The lwIP SNMP sources are in the tree but
nothing compiles them, and every declaration is stripped by `#if LWIP_SNMP`
guards — putting it in `sdkconfig.defaults` is silently ignored. So
`components/snmp_agent/` is a self-contained SNMPv1/v2c agent: one FreeRTOS
task on a BSD socket bound to `0.0.0.0:161`, with its own BER codec. No lwIP
app headers. The only sdkconfig change in the whole feature is
`CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS` 24 → 26 (+1 for the agent's UDP socket, +1
headroom).

**`CONFIG_LWIP_STATS` is a real option, but the wrong tool.** It exists
(`components/lwip/Kconfig`, `default n`) and was considered for traffic
counters, but it only yields the global `lwip_stats` struct — there are no
per-interface byte counters in it. The per-netif counters
(`netif->mib2_counters`) sit behind `MIB2_STATS`, which defaults to 0 and is
only set by `LWIP_SNMP` — unreachable, as above. Traffic is therefore counted
by wrapping the netif function pointers: `netif->input` for RX, and for TX
`netif->linkoutput` on L2 interfaces or `netif->output` on the WireGuard
tunnel, which leaves `linkoutput` NULL. Hooking exactly one TX layer per
interface matters: on Ethernet `output` (etharp) calls `linkoutput`, so
hooking both double-counts.

**The ifTable is a fixed three-row table, not a `netif_list` walk.** It
reports `eth0` (ifIndex 1), `wlan0` (2) and `ts0` (3) — deliberately stable
indices, because a poller graphing ifIndex 2 should not silently start
graphing a different interface when a netif appears or disappears. The
interfaces are resolved by esp_netif ifkey (`ETH_DEF`, `WIFI_STA_DEF`) and,
for the tunnel, by walking `netif_list` for a CGNAT 100.64/10 address — the
same idiom as `find_wg_netif()` in `main/lwip_route_hook.c`, since the
WireGuard netif has no fixed ifkey.

**Hooks install lazily.** `snmp_agent_init()` runs from `app_main` before the
network is up, so no netif exists to wrap yet. A 5 s telemetry timer re-scans
and installs, and re-arms if a netif is torn down and rebuilt — `ts0` does
that on every tunnel reconnect.

**Task stack is 4 KB of internal DRAM, not PSRAM.** The task is created with
plain `xTaskCreate`. The large packet buffers are `static` (BSS) rather than
stack locals: 2.5 KB of locals in the PDU path overflowed a 4 KB stack during
development. Making them static costs no extra RAM and is safe because the
task is single-threaded and the sole caller.

**Backportability to the upstream WiFi-only ESP32 still holds.** The
component includes no W5500 or `eth_driver.h` headers, and resolves
interfaces through esp_netif and lwIP only; the one sdkconfig change
(`CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS`) is a standard knob that applies equally to both
builds, and the socket baseline differs only in that upstream has no W5500
driver sockets, so the +2 headroom is conservative either way. On a
WiFi-only build `ETH_DEF` simply does not resolve, so `eth0` reports
`ifOperStatus down` with zero counters and everything else works unchanged.

## Future-Proofing Notes

### Adding a new page section

1. Add a `.nav-tab` button with `data-page="new-section"` in the nav
2. Add a `<div class="page-section" id="page-new-section">` in the container
3. The JS nav router picks it up automatically — no JS changes needed
4. Add the page's wireframe to `wireframes/` and update this doc

### Adding crash info display

When `reset_reason` is `PANIC` or `WDT`, show an additional `.card.card-stripe-danger` below the uptime card on the Status page. The card renders: task name, PC address, backtrace frames. Backend should add a `crash` object to the `/api/status` response:

```json
"crash": {
  "task": "tiT",
  "pc": "0x400d1234",
  "backtrace": ["0x400d1234", "0x400d5678", "0x400e1abc"]
}
```

The JS `applyStatus()` function checks `data.crash` and conditionally renders this card. When null/absent, card is not shown.

### Internationalisation

No i18n framework is needed now. If Hungarian labels are ever wanted:
- Store all UI strings in a `const STRINGS = {}` object at the top of the script
- Replace hardcoded English strings with `STRINGS.foo` references
- Swapping the object switches language — no framework, no bundle size increase

### Replacing hardcoded peers list with a proper table

The current prototype renders peers as `.peer-row` divs. When the peer count grows or columns are added (RTT, last-seen), switch to a proper `.table` inside `.card-body-flush`. The `.table` component is already defined — it is a CSS swap, not a component rewrite.

### Dark/light mode toggle

All colours are CSS custom properties on `:root`. A light mode variant would override ~15 variables inside a `[data-theme="light"]` selector. The JS toggle sets `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = 'light'` and saves to localStorage. No CSS architecture change required.

---

## Open Questions for Csontikka

### 1. Crash info card placement and trigger
The current Status page shows `reset_reason` as a badge in the Uptime card. When reason is PANIC or WDT, should the crash detail (task + PC + backtrace) appear:
- **Option A:** Inline expansion inside the Uptime card (click "Show crash details")
- **Option B:** A separate `.card.card-stripe-danger` inserted between Uptime and Telemetry
- **Option C:** A banner alert at the very top of the Status page (most visible, hard to miss)

Option C is the most actionable for a developer but most intrusive. What is your preference?

### 2. Nav label visibility on mobile
At 360px, the nav fits 4–5 tabs before needing to scroll. The current design hides the brand name but keeps all tab labels. Two alternatives:
- **Option A (current):** Keep all labels, let the tab row scroll horizontally (hidden scrollbar)
- **Option B:** Icon-only tabs on mobile (≤480px), labels on tablet+ — saves space but requires all 6 icons to be unambiguous without text
- **Option C:** Hamburger menu on mobile that opens a slide-in drawer

Option B is the cleanest on a 360px screen — but only if you are happy with the SVG icon choices. Worth testing on a real phone before committing.

### 3. Auto-refresh interval on Status page
The prototype polls `/api/status` every 30 seconds. For a router admin panel this is reasonable at idle, but during active setup (e.g. watching Tailscale connect) 30s feels slow.
- Keep 30s as the default?
- Add a manual "live mode" toggle that drops to 3s polling while active?
- Or use SSE (Server-Sent Events) for push updates — the ESP32 HTTP server supports chunked transfer, so SSE is feasible without WebSocket complexity.

SSE would make the Status page feel instant and eliminate polling entirely, but adds ~50 lines of JS and a new `/api/events` endpoint on the C side.

### 4. Tailscale page layout split
The prototype puts the Tailscale config form and live peers table side-by-side on desktop. An alternative is two sub-tabs within the Tailscale page: "Configuration" and "Peers". The sub-tab approach is cleaner on tablet where the 2-col layout is tight, but adds a navigation layer.
- **Option A (current):** Side-by-side cards on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Option B:** Sub-tabs within the Tailscale page (Configuration / Peers)

### 5. Inline add vs modal for DHCP reservations and port mappings
The Network page wireframe specifies an inline-row add pattern (a new editable row appends to the table). An alternative is a small modal form. The inline approach is faster but tricky to implement accessibly on mobile (the row may be off-screen). The modal approach is more standard but adds a click.
- Which pattern feels right for the project's UX bar?
- Note: the Firewall page uses the same pattern — the decision should be consistent across both pages.
